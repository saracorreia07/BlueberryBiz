## Project
The result of this project is an app that aims to directly connect the farmer with its clients. The client would be able to buy directly from the farmer, without leaving the house, while contributing to the local economy. These farmers are able to showcase their blueberries, and everyone who wants to buy it, just have to register themselves and select the farmer they want to buy from. In that way, both can have immediate communication, and the product goes directly from the farmer to its client.
